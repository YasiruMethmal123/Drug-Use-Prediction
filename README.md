# Drug Use Prediction Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on predicting drug use based on demographic and behavioral data. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model patterns related to substance use using data science techniques.

## Contents

- `DrugUse.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of drug use data. Includes visualizations and feature engineering.
- `Prediction.ipynb`: Machine learning models to predict drug use. Includes model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis of drug use datasets.
- Train and evaluate classification models to predict drug use.
- Gain insights into key features influencing drug consumption behavior.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/YasiruMethmak/drug-use-prediction.git](https://github.com/YasiruMethmal123/Drug-Use-Prediction.git)
Results
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in predicting drug use, with notable performance on feature importance for certain substances. More details and visualizations can be found in the Prediction.ipynb.
